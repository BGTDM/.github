# BGTDM

## Our Story

The BGTDM gaming community was born out of a desire for a better experience in the GTA SA-MP universe. Frustrated by the issues we faced in a competing English-speaking community, where admin abuses were common, we decided to create a space that prioritized fun and fairness.

In 2017, BlackGreen (Lucas Cervantes) took the initiative to launch our community, starting with the SATDM gamemod as a foundation. What began as a small gathering of friends quickly transformed into something much larger. As we grew, we moved away from SATDM to develop our own unique gamemod, enhancing the gameplay with custom features, roles, teams, vehicles, and systems that reflected our collective vision.

I, Gustavo, was among the first administrators and one of the early programmers, and it has been a rewarding journey filled with challenges and triumphs.

As time went on, many of our original members embraced new responsibilities—families, careers, and personal growth—which caused a shift in our gaming dynamics. While the late-night gaming marathons became less frequent, the experiences we shared were invaluable, profoundly influencing our personal and professional paths in technology.

## What We Are Today

Today, BGTDM thrives as a vibrant Discord community, welcoming former players who wish to reconnect and relive unforgettable moments from one of Rockstar's greatest titles. We celebrate our shared history and the bonds we forged over the years. Join us for a nostalgic reunion filled with laughter and camaraderie!
