# BGTDM
## History
The gaming community focused on GTA SA-MP emerged from our dissatisfaction with a competing English-speaking community. Although we played as regular players, we frequently encountered abuses by the administrators.

In 2017, BlackGreen (Lucas Cervantes) decided to start a new community. At that time, we used a gamemod called SATDM, which served as the first version of our community, hosting it for friends. Over time, we moved away from that gamemod and began developing our own, incorporating functions, roles, teams, vehicles, systems, and much more.

I, Gustavo, was part of the first team of administrators and also one of the programmers for the community.

As time went on, many of our old friends started families and focused on their professional careers, causing the community to lose some of the joy of playing for hours on end with each other. However, this experience was crucial for our personal growth and significantly shaped our professional paths in the technology field.

## What we are today
Today, we maintain an active community on Discord, primarily for former players looking to reminisce about the experiences and memories made in what is one of Rockstar's best games. Here, we celebrate our history and the camaraderie we built over the years. Come be a part of this reunion!
